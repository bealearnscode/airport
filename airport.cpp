/*

Write a program (airport.cpp) that uses a structure to store the following information for a particular month at the local airport. 
Total number of planes that landed
Total number of planes that departed
Greatest number of planes that landed in a given day that month
Least number of planes that landed in a given day that month
This program should have an array of twelve structures to hold travel information for the entire year. The program should prompt the user to enter data for each month. Once all data is entered, the program should calculate and output the average month number of landing planes, the average monthly number of departing planes, the total number of landing and departing planes for the year, and the greatest and least number of planes that landed on any one day (and which month it occurred in).
